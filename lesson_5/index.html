               <p>The history of Windows dates back to <span class="line-through">1980</span> 1981 when Microsoft
                  started work on a program called "Interface Manager." It was announced in November 1983 (after the
                  Apple Lisa, but before the Macintosh) under the name "Windows," but Windows 1.0 was not released until
                  November 1985.</p>
               <p>This article aims to take you on a journey through time, highlighting the significant milestones in
                  the evolution of Windows OS.</p>

            <h3>Introducing Windows 1.0</h3>
            <div class="text">
               <p>Windows 1 was the first version of the Windows operating system. It was released in November 1985 and
                  was the first attempt by Microsoft to create a graphical user interface.</p>
               <p>This means that instead of typing in commands, users could point and click on icons and buttons on the
                  screen.</p>
               <p>Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, led the development of Windows 1. It was designed to run on top
                  of a command-line operating system MS-DOS.</p>
               <img src="img/history-1.png" alt="MS-DOS image" title="operating system MS-DOS">
               <p>Windows 1 relied heavily on a mouse, which was not a common computer input device. Microsoft included
                  a game called Reversi that required a mouse to help users get used to this new way of interacting with
                  a computer.</p>
               <p>Here are some of the key features of Windows 1:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Graphical user interface (GUI) with drop-down menus, tiled windows, and mouse support</li>
                  <li>Device-independent screen and printer graphics</li>
                  <li>Cooperative multitasking of Windows applications</li>
               </ul>

            <h3>Introducing Windows 2.0</h3>
            <div class="text">
               <p>Windows 2 was released by Microsoft in December 1987, two years after Windows 1. The biggest
                  improvement in Windows 2 was that windows could overlap each other, making it easier to work with
                  multiple programs simultaneously.</p>
               <p>Windows 2 also introduced the ability to minimize or maximize windows, which is still used today. </p>
               <p>Another big change in Windows 2 was the introduction of the control panel, which made it easier to
                  find system settings and options. Microsoft Word and Excel were also first released for Windows 2.

            <div class="text">
               <p>Windows 3, released in 1990, was the first version of Windows that became popular. It came
                  pre-installed on many PC-compatible computers and allowed users to run multiple programs
                  simultaneously or "multitask."</p>
               <img src="img/history-3.png" alt="Multitasking" title="Multitasking">
               <p>It also had a more modern, colorful look, supporting 256 colors. Among its most prominent features was
                  the card game Solitaire, a big hit with users.</p>
               <p>Windows 3 was a big success, selling more than 10 million copies and becoming the best-selling
                  graphical user interface ever.</p>

            <div class="text">
               <p>Windows 3.1 was released in 1992 and was an upgrade to Windows 3.0. It was the first Windows version
                  to have TrueType fonts, making it a good publishing platform.</p>
               <p>Minesweeper was also introduced in this version. Windows 3.1 required 1MB of RAM and allowed MS-DOS
                  programs to be controlled with a mouse.</p>
               <img src="img/history-3.1.png" alt="mouse" title="controlled with a mouse">
               <p>It was also the first Windows version to be distributed on a CD-ROM. The new version sold three
                  million copies in just two months.</p>
               <p>The major changes from Windows 3.0 were better multimedia and networking support, TrueType font
                  support, and better error diagnostics.</p>

            <div class="text">
               <p>Windows 95 was released in 1995, and it introduced several new features. The most noticeable change
                  was the Start button and Start menu.</p>
               <img src="img/history-95.png" alt="Windows 95" title="Windows 95">
               <p>The operating system also introduced the concept of "plug and play," which was supposed to find and
                  install drivers for new peripherals automatically but sometimes didn't work. Windows 95 also focused
                  on multitasking and had a 32-bit environment.</p>
               <p>It was designed to work with Windows NT and had greater backward compatibility with older drivers and
                  software. Windows 95 also introduced Internet Explorer but was not installed by default.</p>

                  Windows 95. It introduced several new features and improvements, such as better support for USB

               <p>Windows ME: The operating system released in 2000 could have been better received by many people
                  because it was known to have many problems. It was the last version of Windows that was based on
                  MS-DOS, and it was intended for home use.</p>
               <img src="img/history-me.png" alt="Windows ME" title="Windows ME">
               <p>Windows ME introduced new features like automated system recovery tools, IE 5.5, Windows Media Player
                  7, and Windows Movie Maker. However, it was also known for its bugs and installation issues. </p>
               <p>Windows Me was similar to Windows 98SE and included new capabilities for home networking, video

               <p>Windows 2000 was the first to support hibernation, and Microsoft’s automatic updating played an
                  important role. It is built on Windows NT and comes in three varieties: Professional, Server, and
                  Advanced Server.</p>
               <p>Windows 2000 offered many improvements, such as stronger internet integration, support for up to 4GB
                  of RAM, and eliminated many reboot scenarios. It also had Windows File Protection, which prevented

               <img src="img/history-xp.png" alt="Windows XP" title="Windows XP">
               <p>It also introduced new tools like ClearType, built-in CD burning, and automated updates and recovery
                  tools that worked. While its long lifespan made it popular, its security flaws, especially in Internet
                  Explorer, made it vulnerable to hacking and cyber-attacks.</p>
               <p>It had several versions, including Home and Professional, and new editions like Media Center, Tablet

                  look, with transparent elements and a focus on search and security.</p>
               <p>However, it had some problems. Users had to approve every app that wanted to make changes, making
                  people careless with their security.</p>
               <img src="img/history-vista.png" alt="Windows Vista" title="Windows Vista">
               <p>It was also slow on older computers, despite being labeled "Vista Ready." Windows Vista introduced
                  features like Windows Aero, improved search and multimedia tools, and security enhancements.</p>
               <p>However, it was not just an upgrade from XP but a whole new system.</p>

            <div class="text">
               <p>Windows 7 was released in 2009 as the successor to Windows Vista. It aimed to fix users' problems and
                  complaints with Vista and was considered a huge improvement.</p>
               <img src="img/history-7.png" alt="Windows 7" title="Windows 7">
               <p>Windows 7 was faster, more stable, and easier to use, and many people upgraded to it from Windows XP,
                  skipping Vista entirely. Some new features in Windows 7 included handwriting recognition and the
                  ability to snap windows to the sides of the screen for easier resizing.</p>
               <p>Microsoft faced antitrust investigations in Europe over the pre-installation of Internet Explorer,
                  which led to the introduction of a browser ballot screen.</p>

            <h4>Windows 7 Variations</h4>
            <div class="text">
               <p>Windows 7 is a popular operating system with five versions: Starter, Home Premium, Professional,
                  Enterprise, and Ultimate. However, there are also special versions of Windows 7 called the "N
                  editions."</p>
               <p>These N editions of Windows 7 give you the freedom to choose your own media player and other software
                  to manage and play digital media files, like CDs and DVDs.</p>
               <p>Here are some things you might want to know about Windows 7 N editions:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>Windows 7 N editions are special versions of Windows 7 that let you choose your own media player
                     and other software to manage and play digital media files.</li>
                  <li>The regular versions of Windows 7 come with a built-in media player called Windows Media Player,
                     but the N editions don't have it pre-installed.</li>
                  <li>If you want to use Windows Media Player or other software to manage your digital media files, you
                     must download and install it yourself.</li>
                  <li>The N editions of Windows 7 are available in the same five editions as the regular versions:
                     Starter, Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate. </li>
                  <li>Choosing an N edition of Windows 7 might be good if you have your preferred media player or other
                     software to manage and play your digital media files.</li>

            <h3>Windows 8: A Radical Overhaul</h3>
            <div class="text">
               <p>Windows 8 was launched in 2012 with a completely new interface with the Start button and Start menu
                  replaced with a more touch-friendly Start screen. The new interface had program icons and live tiles
                  displaying information like "widgets."</p>
               <p>A desktop interface similar to Windows 7 was still available. Windows 8 was faster than its
                  predecessors and introduced support for USB 3.0 devices.</p>
               <img src="img/history-8.png" alt="Windows 8" title="Windows 8">
               <p>The Windows Store was introduced, which offered universal Windows apps, but third-party programs could
                  only access the traditional desktop interface. However, the new touch-oriented interface wasn't
                  welcomed by traditional desktop users, who preferred using a mouse and keyboard.</p>
               <p>Windows RT, a version for ARM-based processors, was also introduced.</p>

            <h4>Windows 8 Variations</h4>
            <div class="text">
               <p>Windows 8 has four editions: Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1, Windows 8.1 Enterprise, and Windows RT 8.1.
                  The first two are available for regular people to buy. The third is for big organizations, and the
                  last is for special devices with ARM processors.</p>
               <p>All three editions of Windows 8 mentioned above come in two versions: 32-bit and 64-bit. If you want
                  to upgrade the standard version of Windows 8.1 to Windows 8.1 Pro, you can buy the Windows 8.1 Pro
                  Pack on Amazon.</p>
               <p>Windows RT 8.1 only runs the software that comes with it or that you can download from the Windows
                  Store. You can't install regular Windows software on it.</p>
               <p>Windows 8 and 8.1 are no longer sold, but you can try to find them on Amazon or eBay if you really
                  need them.</p>
               <p>Here's a summary of the different Windows 8 editions:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Windows 8.1 Pro: for regular people who want extra features</li>
                  <li>Windows 8.1: for regular people who don't need the extra features</li>
                  <li>Windows 8.1 Enterprise: for big organizations</li>

               <p>Windows 8.1 was a free update released in October 2013 that aimed to address some of the criticisms of
